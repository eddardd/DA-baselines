# Domain Adaptation Baselines

This repository contains the code for fine-tuning backbones on domain adaptation benchmarks. After fine-tuning,

- one may extract features and use shallow domain adaptation methods
- one may use the weights as the initialization for deep domain adaptation methods

If this code is useful in your research, please consider citing,
